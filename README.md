GitHub Link: https://github.com/thale4/PicturePaint

Description: PicturePaint is an app that allows users to use the camera to take a picture, 
             draw on it, and save that edited image. Users may also decide to load a previously
             drawn on image to re-edit. Paint tools exist for users to change the brush size, transparency,
             and color.
